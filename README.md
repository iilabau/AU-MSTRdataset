## AU-MSTR - A Multi-script Scene Text Reading Dataset

A multi-script indoor-outdoor scene image dataset is developed for text detection, referred to as Aliah University-Multi-script Scene Text Reading (AU-MSTR) dataset.
Digital cameras built in handheld devices such as cellphones, smart phones, portable digital assistants (PDAs), etc. are used for preparation of this dataset due to its fast and easy image acquisition capability under unconstrained environments. In this dataset, word level annotation is prepared for text detection task. Ground Truth (GT) file of each image is prepared separately and included in respective directory.
Images are captured under unconstraint environment using multiple cameras with varying focal length that generates perpective distorted image. Images are also captured in day-light and night, that addsa extra challenges for scene text detection.

### Dataset Summary

Images of AU-MSTR dataset are captured in indoor as well as outdoor environments. Indoor images are mainly captured from bottles, pens, packets, other household accessories etc. whereas outdoor scene images are captured from poster, banner, traffic sign-boards, wall paintings, buildings and other real-life sources. This dataset comprises of a total of 301 scene text images acquired with cell-phone cameras of different resolutions, highest being 12 megapixels. Total images are divided into 2:1 ratio for training and testing. Dataset comprises of three different scripts viz. Latin, Devanagari and Bengali. Some of the images are embedded with more than one scripts, but those images are grouped into any one of the scripts. A brief outline of AU-MSTR dataset with script-wise image distribution is showsn below:

Script:
  1. Latin: Training set- 101, Test set- 50, Total -151
  2. Bengali: Training set - 69, Test set - 34, Total-103
  3. Devanagari: Training set - 31, Test set - 16, Total - 47
  
Total - 301 images (201 Training and 100 Test)
